# CS50x - Musical'sCool

***Musical'sCool is a web application designed to easily add, search and - if needed - remove students from a database.***

<br>

## Usage
Check *requirements.txt* for the required libraries for the code to work. After installing them run `flask run` from your terminal to serve the website locally. Run `python3 init_db.py` to clear the database contents.

<br>

## Notes
The app itself is fairly simple. It's a login/register page, an index where student data is displayed and a user page where the user can edit their login data. The challenge for me was that I decided not to use the CS50 library or IDE. That meant learning VSCode, the SQLite3 library and creating my own helper functions. I've decided not to serve the app anywhere, as the inded usage stores personal data and I don't feel comfortable about it's security.
